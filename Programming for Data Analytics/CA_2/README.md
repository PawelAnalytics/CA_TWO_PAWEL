I used yfinance library which offers a threaded and Pythonic way to download market data from Yahoo to get stock information, and visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. 
In this exercise I am looking at the data and compering: APPLE, GOOGLE, MICROSOFT, and AMAZON. 
I handled stock information with pandas, and to analyze basic attributes of the stock. 

I have created DB with MongoDB and established connection where data is collected and stored established.

What was the change in price of the stock overtime?
The closing price is the last price at which the stock is traded during the regular trading day. A stock’s closing price is the standard benchmark used by investors to track its performance over time.


What was the moving average of the various stocks?
The moving average (MA) is a simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks, or any time period the trader chooses.



What was the daily return of the stock on average?
Calculate returns and draw distribution


What was the correlation between different stocks closing prices?
Correlation is a statistic that measures the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other which has a value that must fall between -1.0 and +1.0. Correlation measures association, but doesn’t show if x causes y or vice versa — or if the association is caused by a third factor.
